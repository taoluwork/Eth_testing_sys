Message flow:

A --requestTask→ X --assignTask→ B --completeTask→ X --validateTask→ B,C,D --submitValidation--> X --checkValidation-> All

Global variables:
	requestCount - # of requests made
	provideCount - # of requests that the contract was able to find a provider for
	numProviders - number of currently registered providers
	spaces - an array that saves the indexes of holes created in the provider mapping when stopProviding is called.
			By popping values from the array we can assign new providers these spots in the mapping.
Global mappings:
	providers - maps uint64 indexes to registered Provider's struct
	providerID - maps addresses of providers to an uint64 index for the mapping to the structs
	balances - maps address to uint256 to keep track of money sent in through requests
	requests - maps uint128 reqID's to Request struct 
	
	
	
	
The whole scenario is working in following steps:
0. Deploy X to the blockchain
	Constructor is called:
		requestCount, provideCount, numProviders all initialized to 0

1. A send requestTask to X
	requestTask(uint64 dataID, uint16 target, uint64 time) payable public returns (bool)
	1. dataID	//Let’s say raw data is stored off-chain. Use this ID to achieve data
	2. target	//error target defined by A, lets say this is a fixed length percentage. E.g. correction rate = 95.1234%, then target = 951234. Correct rate greater than this is acceptable.
	3. time		//time need to be done, deadline = Timelimit + now.
	4. msg.value 	//the money willing to pay, this is passed in the value field of the Tx and saved in requestors balance
	
	Here the contract will create a struct Request using the parameters with the following values:
	struct Request {
		address addr; 			//msg.sender - address of the requestor
		address provider;		//0x0 - updateed in assignTask if an available provider is found
		uint128 reqID;			//requestCount -- global counter
		uint64 dataID;			//parameter passed in as dataID
		uint64 time;			//parameter passed in as time
		uint16 accuracy;		//parameter passed in as target
		uint256 price; 			//parameter passed in as msg.value
		uint64 resultID;		//0 - changed in completeTask
		uint64 numValidationsNeeded; 	//0 - changed when provider submits results and validations are needed
		bool[] validations;		//emptyArray - filled in submitValidation calls
		bool isValid;			//false - changed in checkValidation
		bool complete;			//false - changed in completeTask
    	}
	
	PSUEDOCODE
	init emptyArray
	init Request req
	return assignTask(req)
	
2. X executes assignTask
	assignTask(Request req) private returns (bool)
	1. req - the request struct built in requestTask -- updated throughout process and can be accessed via mapping
	
	PSUEDOCODE
	For each entry of provider mapping:
		if real provider and the request conditions meet their requirements and they are available
			update global balances
			update request.provider
			save request to mapping
			provider.availability = false
			increment global requestCount
			emit event for provider to see and act upon
			return true
		else
			try next provider entry in mapping
	//upon failing to find provider (loop exited)
	send ether back to requestor
	return false
	
3. B sees event with his address, does the requested computation then sends completeTask to X
	completeTask(uint128 reqID, uint64 resultID) public returns (bool)
	1. reqID - the unique ID of the request that is being completed
	2. resultID - similar to dataID. Let’s say raw data is stored off-chain. Use this ID to achieve data
	
	This function confirms that the msg.sender was the original chosen provider then calls validateTask if they were.
	Also sets the provider to be available for a new request again.
	
	PSUEDOCODE
	If msg.sender is the provider of request reqID
		update request.complete
		update request.resultID
		provider.available = true
		return validateTask(reqID)
	else 
		return false
		
4. X executes validateTask
	validateTask(uint128 reqID) private returns (bool)
	1. reqID - unique ID of the request that is being validated
	
	This function selects a certain number of providers to validate the work done by the provider B.
	If not enough providers are available for validation then the function returns false and the provider remains unavailable
	Each validator gets paid a predetermined amount of the original offering from the requestor.
	
	PSUEDOCODE
	validatorsFound = 0
	update request.numValidationsNeeded (possibly 1/10th of total providers, but set to 3 right now)
	For each entry in the provider mapping until validatorsFound == numValidators:
		if provider is real and available
			emit event for validator to see and act upon (nodes C,D,E)
			incrememnt validatorsFound
		else 
			try next provider entry in mapping
	if validatorsFound == numValidators return true
	else return false
	
	
5. C,D,E see event to validate with their address, do computation, and send result to submitValidation
	submitValidation(uint128 reqID, bool result) public returns (bool)
	1. reqID - unique ID used to refer to request being validated
	2. result - true or false, whether results were validated or not
	
	CURRENTLY DOES NOT CHECK WHETHER THE VALIDATORS WERE THE ACTUAL ONES CHOSEN
	ALSO DOES NOT ALSO HAVE A RETURN VALUE -- COULD BE BAD
	
	This function takes in validation results and saves them into the validations array within the request struct
	When the contract sees that enough validations have been submitted it will call checkValidation to determine if the provider is paid.
	
	
	PSUEDOCODE
	init partialPayment - the amount each validator gets paid (currently 1/100th of original offer)
	pay validator and deduct the cost from requestors on-contract balance
	push result onto request.validations array
	if all the validations have been submitted
		payment = remaining ether for task after validators are paid
		return checkValidation(reqID, payment)
		

	
6. X calls checkValidation
	checkValidation(uint128 reqID, uint payment) private returns (bool)
	1. reqID - unique ID used to refer to request that was validated
	2. payment - amount of ether that the provider will receive if work is successfully validated
	
	This function looks through each submitted validation and determines if 2/3 of the submissions were successful.
	If so the work was valid, and the provider gets paid.
	Otherwise the validations failed and the requestor gets some of the money back (validators are paid either way)
	
	PSUEDOCODE
	successCount = 0
	for each validation submitted:
		if validation == true
			successCount++
	if successCount >= 2/3 of request.numValidationsNeeded
		send payment to provider and deduct value from requestors on-contract balance
		request.isValid <- true
	else 
		send payment back to requestor and deduct value from his on-contract balance
	emit event saying task is done (whether successful or not) for requestor to see
	return request.isValid
	
	
	
Registration System:
	To become a provider you must register your provider address in the contracts system.
	This works by determining what type of requests you are willing to fulfill 
	and passing this information to the contract via startProviding function.
	
	1. startProviding(uint64 maxTime, uint16 maxTarget, uint64 minPrice) public 
		1. maxTime - max time you are willing to spend on any given request
		2. maxTarget - max accuracy you can be expected to meet for a request
		3. minPrice - minimum price you will complete a request for

		This function allows a new provider to register and also allows an old provider to 
		update their parameters for the type of requests they will do.

		PSUEDOCODE
		if address isnt already a registered provider
			create the provider and add them to first empty space in the mappings
			numProviders++
		else (address was found in mapping)
			update maxTime, maxTarget, minPrice
			
	2. stopProviding() public
		This function will be called when a provider is done offering his cpu to complete tasks.
		It will remove his address from the mappings and create an empty space for a new provider to fill.
		If they were the most recent provider to register then no empty space will be created, just remove them.
		
		PSUEDOCODE
		if sender is a registered provider
			provider.available = false
			provider.addr = 0
			if sender is not the most recent provider to register
				save their index to spaces array so it can be filled by future provider
			numProviders--
